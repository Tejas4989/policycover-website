    --primary-dark: #00B890;       /* Darker shade for hover states */

   <form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   ```

   - Create an API endpoint to handle form submissions
   - Update the form submission handler in `script.js`

   - Implement server-side code to process and send emails
